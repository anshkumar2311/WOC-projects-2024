    <p>I'm searching for a lovely cat who:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knows how to appreciate a good nap and doesn't mind sharing the bed</li>
        <li>will indulge mw with extra treats when no one is looking</li>
        <li>Enjoys long strolls around the living room (sometimes in circles for no reason)</li>
        <li>can tolerate me sitting on top of the fridge to keep an eye on things.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Get in TouchðŸ˜½</h2>
    <p>If you're intrested, simple send a note through the litter box system(aka your human's phone) or come find me in
        Kitchen at 3 AM <i>-I'll be the on loudly meowing for no reason</i></p>
    <p>P.S. I'm not looking for just any cat. I need a partner who can handle my <b>purfectly ridiculous antics</b></p>
    <h2>Why Marry Me?ðŸ˜»</h2>
